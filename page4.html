<h3 style="color: darkorange;">The Differences Between IP Adress And DNS</h3>
    <h4 style="color:darkolivegreen">An IP address is an address assigned to any computer (including servers) to identify it on a given network. A DNS address is a Domain Name Service which is used to convert alphabetic references into a server's IP address generally for hosting services.

An example of an IP address is your local computer's address that no one else can access: 127.0.0.1. Every machine has this address. It's also known as localhost. This is not your actual IP address, as it will always be different than this. I don't want to confuse you too much, as there is a lot to do with IP addresses.

An example of a DNS name is "ns1.godaddy.com". That URL is a link to GoDaddy's name service. If I had paid for my website address at some other hosting company, I could link that domain name to GoDaddy's name service, and access the files I have stored on GoDaddy's server.

The best thing to do for both of these concepts is to read more into them by searching the terms on Google and reading articles about them. There is quite a bit that goes into both terms.</h4>
<h3 style="color: darkorange;">What Are The Commons Between IP Adress And DNS</h3>  
      <h4 style="color: darkolivegreen;">What is in common between DNS - the Domain Name System, and IP addresses? It is the fact that the DNS is an Internet service that translates domain names/hostnames to IP addresses (forward DNS) and IP addresses to their associated domain names/hostnames (Reverse DNS) with the help of a DNS server.

This is one of the crucial services on the Internet, greatly facilitating the access of users to websites, by helping each visitor refer to the desired website only by typing its alpha-numeric name (domain name) in the browser instead of its real numeric system name (IP address).
